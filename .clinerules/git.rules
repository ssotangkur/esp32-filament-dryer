# Git Commit Rules

## Commit Behavior

NEVER commit changes automatically. Always wait for explicit user approval before running `git commit`.

### Prohibited Actions:
- Do not run `git commit` without explicit user instruction
- Do not assume permission to commit based on successful builds
- Do not commit "working solutions" or "completed tasks" automatically

### Required Actions:
- Always ask user permission before committing
- Wait for explicit "yes", "commit", or "go ahead" before running commit commands
- If user says "don't commit automatically anymore", strictly adhere to this rule

### Exception:
Only commit immediately if user explicitly says something like:
- "Commit this now"
- "Go ahead and commit"
- "Commit the changes"
- "Please commit"

### Reminder:
This rule prevents accidental commits and ensures user has full control over when changes are committed to version control.
