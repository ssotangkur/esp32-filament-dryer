# Windows Environment Rules

## Operating System: Windows 11

This project is developed on Windows 11 with Visual Studio Code as the primary IDE.

## Command Execution

All CLI commands must be executed using PowerShell syntax and commands.

### Correct Usage:
- Use PowerShell cmdlets and syntax for all command-line operations
- Avoid bash or Unix-style commands unless explicitly compatible
- When executing commands, ensure they are formatted for PowerShell

### Why this is necessary:
1. The default shell environment is cmd.exe, but PowerShell provides better scripting capabilities
2. PowerShell offers consistent command syntax across different Windows systems
3. It supports more advanced automation and error handling features
4. Ensures compatibility with Windows-specific tools and environments

### Common PowerShell Commands:
- Get-ChildItem (equivalent to ls/dir)
- Set-Location (equivalent to cd)
- New-Item (equivalent to touch/mkdir)
- Remove-Item (equivalent to rm/del)

### Error Prevention:
Running bash-style commands (e.g., `ls`, `cd /path`) directly may fail with errors like:
```
'ls' is not recognized as an internal or external command
```

Always use PowerShell equivalents and syntax for command execution.
