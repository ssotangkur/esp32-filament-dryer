  "input_requirements": [
    "Current git status showing staged and modified files",
    "Git diff to understand the nature of modifications",
    "Project-specific commit message conventions"
  ],
  "process_steps": [
    "Run `git status` to identify staged files and modified files",
    "If staged files exist AND no modified files have the same names → commit only staged files",
    "If any file appears as both staged and modified → prompt parent agent for user decision",
    "If no staged files exist → proceed with committing all changes",
    "Analyze changes in selected files to understand the nature of modifications",
    "Generate hierarchical commit message with intent and specific changes",
    "Validate commit message and execute commit with proper error handling"
  ],
  "expected_output": [
    "Successful git commit with hierarchical commit message",
    "Detailed error information if commit fails",
    "User prompt (via parent agent) when conflict situations arise",

  "example_usage": "task(subagent_type=\"general\", prompt=\"Perform a git commit operation in the ESP32 filament dryer project. First check git status to identify staged vs modified files. If there are staged files without corresponding modified files, commit only those staged files. If the same file is both staged and modified, ask the parent agent for user input on how to proceed. If no files are staged, commit all changes. Generate a hierarchical commit message with bullet points describing the intent and subpoints describing specific changes made. Follow the project's conventional commit format.\")"
